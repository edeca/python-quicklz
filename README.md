# Python QuickLZ

This repository contains a basic implementation of QuickLZ (http://www.quicklz.com/) in pure Python. The API is identical to the Java and C# versions of the official implementation.

There are no external dependencies and therefore the code works on both Windows and Linux.

At this time, only decompression is supported. Decompression has been tested with a variety of compressed sources. No effort has been made to optimise this code.
